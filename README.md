# color-contrast

node script to check color contrast in themes and offer AA meeting shades

Make sure to install the 'color' package using `npm install color` before running the script.

This script defines two functions: `getContrastRatio` to calculate the contrast ratio between two colors, and `findAccessibleTextColor` to find a suitable text color that meets the WCAG contrast ratio requirements. Adjust the `backgroundColor` and `textColors` variables with your desired colors.
